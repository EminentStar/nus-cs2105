Assignment 0 is an ungraded programming exercise for warming up towards your Assignments 1 and 2.

You may download the <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ooiwt/cs2105/1314s2/a0.pdf">PDF version of Assignment 0</a> here.  The exercise is intentionally not well defined.  It is meant to introduce you to some Java classes that you will be using in CS2105. So, play around with the classes, code as much as you like, go crazy, and have fun!
