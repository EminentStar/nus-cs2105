Here is your second DIY exercise.  This is an ungraded exercise, but completing the exercise should help you understand the materials covered in class.

You are encouraged to ask questions and discuss your results online on the blog.

This exercise uses a tool called wireshark.  A <a href="https://vimeo.com/19958319">brief demo of wireshark</a> is available.
