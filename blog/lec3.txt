``Sending Data Reliably over the Internet is Harder than You Think.  The Intricacy Involved in Ensuring Reliability   Will Make Your Head Explode.''
</p>
This is the first lecture on transport layer.  After briefly describing the role of transport layer, I will delve deep into the question of how to build a reliable protocol on top of an unreliable delivery service.

<p>
We will not discuss any actual protocol (TCP or UDP) this week.
