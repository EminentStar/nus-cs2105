``These Protocols Transmit At Random Interval. It May Sound Ridiculous, But The Reason They Do It Is Simply Beautiful.''

This week we continue our venture down the protocol stack, and look at the 
link layer.  We will review the services provided by the link layer, how error detection/correction is done, how shared medium are accessed, and finish up with a discussion on Ethernet frame format.
