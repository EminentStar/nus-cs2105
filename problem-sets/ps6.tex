	\question \textbf{(CS2105 Final Exam, April 2006)}
	The following diagram shows a simple network topology with 4 nodes.
	The links in the diagram are labeled with the cost of each link. 
	The nodes run distance vector routing protocol.  The protocol has
	terminated, and each node knows the cost of the minimum cost path
	to every other node.

\begin{parts}

\part The following table shows an incomplete routing table at node $x$.
Fill in the missing distance vector for $x$ and $z$.

\centerline{
\begin{tabular}{|r|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& cost to $w$ & cost to $x$ & cost to $y$ & cost to $z$ \\
\hline
from $x$ &  & 0 &  &  \\[10pt]
\hline
from $y$ &  &   & 0 &  \\[10pt]
\hline
from $z$ &  &   &  &  0 \\[10pt]
\hline
\end{tabular}
}
\vspace{0.5cm}

\part Now, suppose the cost of the link between $x$ and $w$ 
increases from 3 to 20.  Node $x$ detects the changes in the 
cost.  Before $x$ receives any new distance vector 
from its neighbors, triggered by these changes, $x$ recomputes its 
new minimum-cost path to $w$, $y$, and $z$, and updates its distance
vector.

Suppose that poisoned reverse is NOT used.  
What is the new computed cost from $x$ to $w$?


\part Suppose that poisoned reverse is used.
What is the new computed cost from $x$ to $w$?

	\question \textbf{(KR, Chapter 4, Problem 25)}
	Consider the network fragment shown below.  $x$ has only two attached
	neighbors, $w$ and $y$.  $w$ has a minimum-cost path to destination $u$
	(not shown) of 5, and $y$ has a minimum-cost path to $u$ of 6.  The
	complete paths from $w$ and $y$ to $u$ (and between $w$ and $y$) are not
	shown.  All link costs in the network have strictly positive integer
	values.

	\begin{parts}
	\part Give $x$'s distance vector for destinations $w$, $y$ and $u$.
	\part Give a link-cost change for either $c(x,w)$ or $c(x,y)$ such that
	$x$ will inform its neighbors of a new minimum-cost path to $u$ as a
	result of executing the distance vector algorithm.
	\part Give a link-cost change for either $c(x,w)$ or $c(x,y)$ such that
	$x$ will \textit{not} inform its neighbors of a new minimum-cost path to
	$u$ as a result of executing the distance vector algorithm.
